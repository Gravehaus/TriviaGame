Homework Assignment- Javascript 2


This was a good assignment. I'm glad I tried something different and started with the design first then the coding that way I could visualize what I wanted. I'm still working through understanding the process but overall it seems to be working out. I've picked random video game trivia for people to take a shot at and there is a ten second time for the user to guess. The score is tallied at the end and the user will know how they did.

(Edit: I've been tweeking with only the CSS over the weekend and making everything shiny. I'd like to learn more about adding gifs into js/jq without relying on CSS and definitely not HTML-inline coding.)

(A work in progress.)
